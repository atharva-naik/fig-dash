An intelligent workspace, with a chromium browser instance at the centerstage and multiple helper widgets to boost your productivity. This is an opensource hobby project.

## Aims of this project
### Current Agenda
1. Emultate the rich set of features current browser possess with QWebEngineView (bookmarking)
2. Create rich set of widgets and a carefully designed dashboard to boost productivity of the average PC user.
3. Log usage data like time spent browsing various topics, calendar based event scheduling, screen time analysis etc., visualize it and generate insights

### Future Steps
1. Allow external windows as tabs as well so that they can be managed by a single window
2. Create an automated pipeline that can share results of logged data and possibly recommend changes to increase productivity.
